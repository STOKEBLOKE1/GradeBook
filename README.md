Collects and calculates the average grade of students using collections, console input, interfaces, abstract classes and encapsulation via getters and setters.

This was a project provided by Scott Allen via the PluralSight website https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/csharp-fundamentals-dev/table-of-contents

Working through this course over a number of months helped me to understand a lot of the C# and OOP basics and how the language accomodates for OOP via Encaspulation and Inheritance. To a far lesser extent I attempted to understand the concepts of polymorphism within C# but still continue to investigate this area.
